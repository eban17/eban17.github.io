<p>For this assignment we used our data set from kaggle. We chose to go with the world happiness data set because it piqued our interest.  We wanted to know what countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness in the happiness scale index and the factors that contribute to happiness? 
	We have tried to build very complicated geographic visualizations since we are unfamiliar with d3.js.  We eventually gave in. Finally, we decided to go with a bar chart since itâ€™s a little bit easier and Prof. Anna also taught us how to scale the x-axis and y-axis that made our development much easier. We chose to go with a drop down interactive style for our assignment. Depending upon the drop down chosen the values on the bar chart changes to show the respective changes and applies almost immediately. We also added a tooltip functionality in which when you hover over a bar it shows the count for respective data. At first we tried to implement a world map that shows the data on the respective countries, however it was difficult to implement since neither of us had experience in d3 to pull it off.But we did manage to implement world data in which a checkbox was added in. When the user interacts with these checkboxes the corresponding data shows up on the world map as well. 
	The work was split evenly amongst ourselves. It took about two weeks of developing and planning on what we had envisioned. We spent our time learning d3 through youtube tutorials as well as web  tutorials. We spent approximately over 60 hours working on this project in order to understand the concept and how things work together. In order for us to work together in real time we used a plugin in visual studio called live share. Since we were inexperienced we were challenged with every aspect of this assignment.
